//! Connection pool and forward-only schema application.
//!
//! Every `db-migrations/pg/*.sql` runs in filename order and applied filenames are
//! recorded in `schema_migration`. Chosen over Alembic for the Python original because
//! the schema is small, the migration path is forward-only, and the MCP process must
//! never hold DDL rights.
//!
//! `sqlx::migrate!` cannot be used here. It wants its own `_sqlx_migrations` table
//! keyed by version number and checksum; ours is `schema_migration(filename,
//! applied_at)` and the live database already holds applied rows in that shape.
//! Worse, the macro would `CREATE TABLE` on startup, and the MCP role deliberately has
//! no DDL rights. So the applier is hand-written against the same table, and
//! [`assert_migrations`] reads and never writes.
