//! The MCP process, as its own binary.
//!
//! This binary links `whatsapp-core` and `whatsapp-mcp` and nothing else.
//! `whatsapp-client` is not in its dependency graph, so the code that could call WhatsApp
//! is not in the process at all, and `tests/archive/isolation.rs` keeps the manifests
//! honest about it.
//!
//! No argument parser: there are two modes and one of them is a flag. A crate for that
//! is a crate to keep patched for nothing.
